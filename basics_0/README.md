Networking and technology concepts

1. **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)**:
   The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols and technologies interact within a network. It divides network communication into seven layers, each responsible for specific functions. These layers are (from bottom to top): Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

2. **Different Types of Networks**:
   - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited geographical area, like a home, office, or campus.
   - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: WAN covers a larger geographical area, connecting LANs across cities or countries.
   - **Internet**: The global network of networks that spans the entire world, connecting billions of devices.

3. **MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)**:
   A MAC address is a unique hardware address assigned to a network interface card (NIC) in a device. It is a 48-bit (in most cases) or 64-bit (in some cases) address and is used for data link layer communication.

4. **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**:
   An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on a network.

5. **Private and Public IP Addresses**:
   Private IP addresses are used within a private network (e.g., your home or office). Public IP addresses are globally routable and are used for communication over the internet.

6. **IPv4 and IPv6**:
   - **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**: The older version of the Internet Protocol, using 32-bit addresses.
   - **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**: The latest version of the Internet Protocol, using 128-bit addresses to solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.

7. **Localhost**:
   "Localhost" is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access network services via the loopback network interface. It's often used to test network applications on the same device.

8. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
   - **TCP**: A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable and error-checked data delivery. It is used for applications that require data integrity, such as web browsing and email.
   - **UDP**: A connectionless protocol that provides faster, but less reliable, data delivery. It is used for applications like online gaming and streaming.

9. **TCP/UDP Ports List**:
   These are numerical identifiers used by TCP and UDP to distinguish different services on the same device. For example, HTTP typically uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.

10. **Ping / ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**:
    Ping is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network and measure the round-trip time for packets to travel to the host and back. It uses ICMP to send echo requests and receive echo replies.

11. **Positional Parameters**:
    In the context of programming or scripting, positional parameters refer to the arguments passed to a function or script in a specific order. They are accessed by their position and do not have names or labels. For example, in a Python function, `def func(arg1, arg2):`, `arg1` and `arg2` are positional parameters.
